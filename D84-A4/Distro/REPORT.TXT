7 .- (4 marks) Comment on the experiments in 4, 5, and 6, and give your conclusion
	       regarding the effect of the number of hidden units on classification
	       accuracy. 
		
			If the number of units in the hidden layer is too low, it sends too little information to the outer layer, which then skews the results
			making it harder to classify the result correctly.  If the number is very high, we get better results but the success rate gained is not that great compared to the amount of time
			we have to spend doing the extra computations.
		
	       What is the network with 3 hidden telling you about this classification
	       problem?
		   
		   It's telling us that we can only recognize 3 numbers (2, 6 and 7), so perhaps the 3 units contained in the hidden layer became features that recognize some common thing in those numbers

8 .- (5 marks) Train the best performing network you can. Use any activation function
	       you wish, and set the number of hidden units so as to achieve the best
	       performance.

	       Number of hidden units used: 785
